## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Simulating communities

Randomly generate abundance counts for 10 OTUs across 30 samples.

```{r}
sim_community <- matrix(sample(1:100, 300, replace = TRUE),
                        nrow = 10, ncol = 30,
                        dimnames = list(
                          paste("OTU", 1:10, sep = "_"),
                          paste("Sample", 1:30, sep = "_")
                        )
  
)
```

Visualize the communities.

```{r}
sim_community %>% 
  t() %>% 
  melt() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Var1, y = fct_rev(Var2), fill = value)) + 
  geom_tile() +
  labs(x = "", y = "", 
       title = "Community composition of simulated community") + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90),
        legend.position = "none",
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```
